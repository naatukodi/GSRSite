    <p>
        We aim to create a sustainable, eco-friendly cycle for organic chicken farming. We:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Deliver 45-day-old, high-quality organic chicks</li>
        <li>Provide ongoing feed and veterinary support</li>
        <li>Offer a buy-back option at 2.5â€“3 kg</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        By raising Black Soldier Fly larvae on leftover food, we provide an eco-friendly feed that reduces waste.
